# IK-of-Puma-Robot-using-ANN
The PUMA (Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly) robot is a 6-DOF industrial manipulator with a human-arm-like structure. Developed by Unimation, it’s widely used in robotics for tasks like assembly and welding. Its precise joint control makes it ideal for studying inverse kinematics using neural networks.

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of the **inverse kinematics** for the PUMA 560 robot arm. The notebook demonstrates step-by-step computations and code for solving joint angles based on desired end-effector positions.

## 📁 Contents

- `PUMA_560_final.ipynb` – Main notebook with code and logic for inverse kinematics
- Python packages used: `numpy`, `sympy`

## ⚙️ Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install numpy sympy
````

You can run the notebook using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or any IDE that supports `.ipynb` files like VS Code or JupyterLab.
