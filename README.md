The PUMA (Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly) robot is a 6-DOF industrial manipulator with a human-arm-like structure. Developed by Unimation, itâ€™s widely used in robotics for tasks like assembly and welding. Its precise joint control makes it ideal for studying inverse kinematics using neural networks.
